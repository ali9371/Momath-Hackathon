# Momath-Hackathon-2017-
Our Math Square project

Members: Angie Li, David Xue, Yuki Fang, Davin Lin

The Math:
Our project explores an area in graph theory, specifically Eulerian and Hamilitonian graphs and paths. 

The Submission:
Majority of us were first exposed to graph theory in a math research class last year and we wanted museum attendees (especially children)to view graph theory in fun and exciting lens. Our idea was to make the graphs interactive and entertaining through the Math Square platform by giving them a challenge/puzzle to find a path and/or circuit to the graph that would be displayed. While sometimes the multiple edges and vertices of the graphs may make them seem complex and intimidating, planar graphs can also be beautiful representations of math.

Additional Notes:
We originally explored the wolfram language and wanted to use a program we created there to allow the Math Square to randomly generate graphs and ended up taking those ideas into JavaScript for the Math Square. Our team consists of high school students(who love math!), and half of us had no prior experience on hackathons.
